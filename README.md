# SnakeWaterGun

A JavaScript project imitating the children's game of Snake Water Gun (kinda like, yk Rock Paper Scissors, just a little sassy).

I am sure you all must have played Rock Paper Scissors, there is not a person alive that does not know of it or anything similar, if there is, hmu let's talk about how much you missed out on. Anyway, the rules are similar.
<br>

:snake: can traverse the waters. To be so mighty to thrive in the inhospitable deep below.
<br>
:ocean: is terrifying, is humongous, is something to actually be scared of. The Waters can turn your weapons dull. Especially your guns.
<br>
:gun: the weapon forged by man to protect himself from whatever beasts lurk the lands. Not even the mighty poisonous snakes can escape. Shoot until it is done.


Big props to TheOdinProject, it is where im learning from and the inspiration for this project.
